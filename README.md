Code refractor homework week 1

The goal of this homework assignment is to: learn neat and organized syntax, consolidate code, improve accessibility to documents, improve functionality by making the code easier to read, delete useless stuff

Changes I made to the HTML file

I added a relevant title, whereas before it just read "website"
line 8:
<title>Horiseon SEO</title>

I changed settings for the menu options, so that they all behaved similarly. One of the options didnt scroll down when clicked like it was supposed to, that works now. I added this by recognizing it from another piece of code:
line 32:
<div id="search-engine-optimization" class="search-engine-optimization">
  
I added multiple photo alt attributes for accessibility standards
I added multiple icon alt attributes for accessibility standards
lines 34; 42; 50; 61; 69; 77
alt="photo of cluttered desk
alt="photo of laptop in use
alt="photo of team collaboration"
alt="sales funnel icon"
alt="lightbulb with wifi icon"
alt="money signs icon"

Changes I made to the CSS file
Here I labeled sections which have similar info, so that it is easy to find info related to certain html sections
I consolidated some lines of code into a single line


Here is what I did in the CSS

Noted purpose of lines number 11 through 189
removed 3 lines of code i felt i didnt' need on line 35
