Code refractor homework week 1

The goal of this homework assignment is to: learn neat and organized syntax, consolidate code, improve accessibility to documents, improve functionality by making the code easier to read, delete useless stuff

Changes I made to the HTML file
I changed settings for the menu options, so that they all behaved similarly. One of the options didnt scroll down when clicked like it was supposed to, that works now.
I added multiple photo alt attributes for accessibility standards
I added multiple icon alt attributes for accessibility standards
Here I cleaned up and consolidated multiple divs/sections to make for cleaner code

Changes I made to the CSS file
Here I labeled sections which have similar info, so that it is easy to find info related to certain html sections
I consolidated some lines of code into a single line
